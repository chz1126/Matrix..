## Building

To build the matrix operations program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory, then compile the program using the following command:


gcc -o matrix_operations matrix_operations.c


This will create an executable file named `matrix_operations` in your project directory.

## Running

To run the compiled program, simply execute the following command in your terminal:


./matrix_operations


This will run the program and display the results of the matrix operations.

## Usage

The program creates two 2x2 matrices, performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and then prints the results to the console.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `matrix_operations.c`: The main C source file containing the implementation of the matrix operations.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides information about the project.

### Matrix Operations

- **Addition**: Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one matrix from another of the same dimensions.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices where the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
